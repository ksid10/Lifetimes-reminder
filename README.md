# Lifetimes-reminder

\#Eternal Echoes
Eternal Echoes is a unique time management application that revolutionizes how we perceive and interact with time. Using visual time awareness and dynamic progress tracking, it transforms abstract temporal concepts into tangible, interactive experiences.

\#\#Features
Dynamic Time Visualization: Aquarium-style progress bars with animated water, bubbles, and surface waves.

Dual Tracking Systems: Monitor both "Lifetimes" (ongoing events) and "Reminders" (upcoming deadlines).

Adaptive Progress Calculation: Intelligent scaling based on deadline proximity.

Color-Coded Status: Visual urgency cues with dynamic color changes.

Drag-and-Drop Prioritization: Easily rearrange reminders to reflect priorities.

Theme Support: Choose between Light, Dark, and Blue themes.

Customizable Display: Adjust card shape and size to optimize your view.

Complete Data Backup: Export and import all data in a single JSON file.

\#\#Installation
